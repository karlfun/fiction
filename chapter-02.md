# Chapter 2

Den didn't have time to do anything but try to get Aurora out of the building. He grabbed the antique rug from in front of the decorative fireplace on the first floor (also part of Mr. P's famed collection), and put it next to Aurora. He rolled her unconscious body onto the rug, grabbed two corners, and started to drag her toward the doors. 

Den and Aurora were both fit people, but this effort felt colossal. He was exhausted. His lungs were full of smoke and he could hardly get a breath. His legs were aching from running through the library. His glasses were smudged, his hands were filthy, and the soles of his shoes were already half melted and sticky. A coughing fit caused him to stop and wheeze near the reference desk, but he crouched low, beneath the smoke, and pressed on toward the front. He could barely see the doors, but the Exit sign cast a red glow through the dusty brown clouds of circulating paper particles. He slammed his back through the first set of doors, and then the next, dragging the rug and Aurora out onto the landing. 

Now that he was outside, Den could see that the fire had broken out windows all around the second floor and some of the first. Flames were burning out of the window holes like the breath of some evil dragon. The air outside was so much better, but the building and everything around it was hot. He needed to get Aurora away from the entrance, and much further away from the building. But he had two flights of stairs between them and the path away from the library. 

Den cursed under his breath. 

*Damn these old buildings. Who on earth puts stairs in front of every building? It looks fine at a Catholic Church but has no place at a 1960s Library. This is a place for the young and old. Your accessibility sucks!*

Aurora was still unconscious, but he could see that the cleaner air was having a positive effect. She was starting to stir and cough. Den knew he needed to get her to a safer place, fast. 

He took a page from his skateboarding days, and decided to fall. 

He wrapped himself up in the charred carpet with Aurora, holding her head to his shoulder, wrapping his free arm and his legs around her back. He grabbed onto the stair railing and dragged their body-bundle to the top of the stairs. He took a deep breath, and then gave the railing a good shove. 

Den and Aurora rolled violently down the first flight of stairs to the second landing. Den only hit his head once on the stairs, but he made sure Aurora wouldn't hit hers. He pushed again for them to roll down the second set. Another jarring tumble, and they were beyond the building, beyond the flames, and out of the worst of the heat. 

He untangled himself from Aurora and the rug, and sat up for a moment. It hurt to breathe. He might have broken a rib in this stupid stunt. 

"What the hell did you do that for?" Aurora asked him from over his shoulder. 

"AURORA! You're alive! Oh my god I was so worried. Come here!" Den started to cry and reached for her. 

"No really, the stairs, Den? What the hell? I was fine before that, and now I'm covered in bruises," Aurora said to him, a slight tone of sarcasm on her voice. 

"You were *not* fine," he said. "You were unconscious next to the metal stacks in the Peterson collection! You could have died in there!"

"I know, Den, I was kidding. I'm so glad you found me. I started to pass out and ran to the A section. I thought you might think to look for me next to  *Aurora Borealis*."
