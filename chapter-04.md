The Springfield Library didn't collapse, but nearly everything in it burned. Except, of course, for the majority of the Peterson Collection. Forty copies of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," saved from the worst fire in the modern history of the state of Missouri. 

Den, Aurora, and the rest of their rebellious Springfield contingent needed to regroup after the fire, so Den and Aurora called a meeting at their house. Almost everyone in their circle had come to the conclusion that staying, at least for now, would be untenable. Old Carl Sarasota told everyone he'd be staying, regardless, and Stef Pinkston said the same thing. Home was home and there was nothing that would get them to move. 

As the wreckers moved on the Library mere blocks away, Aurora cursed the anti-educators. 

"They'll probably build another goddamn private school on the same foundation. The bastards!" 

"Or a prison for activists," Den glumly offered. 

"What the hell were you two doing in the Library while it caught on fire, anyway?" Old Carl asked them. 

After exchanging a mischievous glance with Aurora, Den offered a short response. 

"Probably nothing. Nothing anyone will see for a long time, anyway."

The Proud Front had already claimed credit for the arson of the library. Known for its dramatics, and rumored to have many members in positions of local and regional authority, the proto-terrorist group had padlocked school doors, bulldozed bus benches and shelters, and harassed alleged members of the public school supporting groups. And now, they burned a library. It was mostly symbolic, of course, as much of the collection was online and backed up in triplicate. To intentionally burn a public gathering place focused on knowledge was a clear message of anti-intellectualism. No member of the Proud Front had ever been prosecuted by law enforcement, because, according to the media, "they had never been caught." Den and Aurora and the other activists had more sinister suspicions.

Their heinous acts were working as intended. Teachers were already in short supply before the terror started, now the school district couldn't even hire administrators. Some educators defected to the private schools, where the pay was dramatic and the class sizes were compact. But they drove to school under cover of darkness, parked in the access-gated garages under the schools, and quit showing their faces in the grocery stores. This new system wasn't about education. It was about power. 

"How to Win Friends and Influence People" would surely be a popular read in the dark years to come.
