Charlie and Luke used to be pretty happy, carefree kids, but lately, anxiety had made its way into their lives. Charlie, who had just turned 12, was a little more tuned in to the powerful forces vying for her attention. Luke, who was 8, was still mostly interested in catching bugs and snakes, and didn't understand why he might have to change schools soon, or move to a new city. 

Until a couple years ago, their lives had lots of routine and predictability. School during the schoolyear, summer days at Grandma's house, weekends for projects and family adventures, and dinner with Mom and Dad pretty much every night. When Den and Aurora started having the funny meetings with all the interesting people, taking over the living room, Luke and Charlie started to join and learn what was going on. They mostly played with Lego bricks on the other side of the couch, but occasionally the adults would engage with them, either to play, or ask their thoughts about school. Charlie always felt so important when she got to answer one of their questions. 

Their parents had told them that they were going on a trip soon - maybe even moving across the country. They would need to pack their own bags, and get their house ready for some friends to stay there for a long time. It was hard to think about leaving home, but the prospect of a cross-country adventure was pretty exciting. The kids hadn't been on a big trip for many years, and Luke had never been on a train.
