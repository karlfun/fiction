A thousand miles west of Springfield, outside of Denver, a fight was breaking out. Not a street fight, but a vicious fight of public opinion about schools. The schooling controversy had only recently reached the Front Range, and it was playing out in dramatic headlines. 

First, the Littleton School District put up a sign outside the school which read, "Public School 80 years ago, and 80 years into the future." Formally founded in 1949, the district had a history of recruiting good teachers from all over the country, and was known for its progressive curriculum. The sign struck a nerve with the conservative factions of Denver. 

One elementary school principal in Lakewood made a new rule requiring all faculty and staff to be trained in the national private school curriculum being pushed by the anti-ed crowd. Many teachers went along with it, wanting to keep their jobs. But a few, including some who had been at the school for more than a decade, were vocal opponents. 

"We're being indoctrinated into this nonsense policy. It's outrageous!" Thomas Ross, fourth grade teacher, told the press.
