"If we can't stay in Springfield, we'll go east," Den said. 

"We'll go to New York." 

Gasps and other cries burst forth from the activists still gathered in Aurora & Den's cramped living room. 

"But it's *so* dangerous to travel, Den! You'll get locked up or killed before you ever hit St. Louis!" said Molly, an elder activist in their group. 

"We won't take the highways," Den continued. "We'll take the train. And we'll be disguised as dockworkers." 

"Dockworkers! No offense, Den, but *no one* is going to believe you're a dockworker, you're much too pretty." Tim razzed him. 

"OK, I know this doesn't make sense yet, but *this* is the opportunity that sits before us. Listen. If we can take the train to St. Louis, we can get to the waterways. If we get to the waterways, we can get to Chicago. If we get to Chicago, we're at the Great Lakes! The anti-eds steer clear of the lakes. It's our best shot to get to the east coast." 

"But dockworkers, Den? There needs to be more to this plan." Molly chimed in again.

With a grin, Den replied, "There is." 

"Each year, St. Louis holds the annual meeting of the International Dockworkers Union. Barges, buses, cars, planes, and trains full of Dockworkers converge on St. Louis for a full week at the end of July. They come from all over the country, from every coastline, riverbank, every lake and pond. If we can get on the train that last week of July, we'll be surrounded by Dockworkers, and no one will bat an eye." Den told the group victoriously.

"But Den, the Dockworkers are infamously split on the education issue! They are *not* our allies. How will we know who to trust?" Tim interjected. 

"It's a good question, Tim, and it's the only part that gives me pause. My contacts in New York are trustworthy, and they're the ones setting us up with uniforms, name tags, meeting registration, the whole kit. Other than them â€” trust no one." Den said. 

"Is it likely they'll be voting on the education issue at their meeting, Den? That could get ugly." Molly asked. 

"Yes. Violence is expected, Molly. We will have to be very, very careful."
