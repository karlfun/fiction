A thousand miles west of Springfield, outside of Denver, a fight was breaking out. Not a street fight, but a vicious fight of public opinion about schools. The schooling controversy had only recently reached the Front Range, and it was playing out in dramatic headlines. 

First, the Littleton School District put up a sign outside the school which read, "Public School 80 years ago, and 80 years into the future." Formally founded in 1949, the district had a history of recruiting good teachers from all over the country, and was known for its progressive curriculum. The sign struck a nerve with the conservative factions of Denver. 

One elementary school principal in Lakewood made a new rule requiring all faculty and staff to be trained in the national private school curriculum being pushed by the anti-ed crowd. Many teachers went along with it, wanting to keep their jobs. But a few, including some who had been at the school for more than a decade, were vocal opponents. 

"We're being indoctrinated into this nonsense policy. It's outrageous!" Thomas Ross, fourth grade teacher, told the press. 

Ross wasn't employed by the Lakewood district for much longer after that. 

The private school curriculum, called *Veritas*, was a series of age-based modules, which according to the program's marketing materials, was designed to "turn today's children into tomorrow's leaders." In reality, it was entirely based on traditional hierarchy and absolute compliance. Heavy emphasis was put on perfect attendance, standardized testing, and athletic performance. *Veritas* schools had no art programs, no music programs, and limited math to algebra and science to animal biology. Extracurricular languages were eliminated, except for Latin, and literature was limited to classics, mostly written more than 150 years ago by white men. Physical Education consisted of marching in formation to pre-recorded orchestral features, and was typically the rehearsal for half-time performance at the school's football games, where attendance was comulsory, anyway. Sports were oddly still allowed in *Veritas* schools, but extra care
