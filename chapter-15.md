As soon as Den and Aurora heard about the plans of *Veritas*, they knew they had to act. They brought Charlie and Luke to the curators' safe home near PS1, and joined the others in the school building to work out a counter-plan.  

If *Veritas* was going to interrupt power for a hundred schools in Appalachia, PS1 would catch them in the act, and broadcast the truth to the whole world. And they'd have a plan for restoring power, too.

What *Veritas* didn't know, and wouldn't expect, is that the schools in Appalachia were actually incredibly well networked and interlinked with the preservation movement. Sometimes a stereotype can provide great cover for subterfuge.

Malcolm called his friend Terrence Copley in Knoxville. Terrence was born and raised in Tennessee, and was a high school chemistry teacher in the city. He also happened to be one of the hosts of education preservation meetings happening quietly in coffee shops and living rooms across the state. Malcolm and Terrence knew each other from college, where they met playing ultimate frisbee and smoking pot between classes. 

"Terrence! How the hell are ya, bud?" Malcolm said on the phone.

"Malcolm, wow, it's been a long time..." Terrence trailed off. "I'm well, friend. It's good to hear from you. Is everything OK?"

"Fine, considering." Malcolm answered gruffly. "These shitbirds are really pushing this *Veritas* crap, even here in New York. Never thought I'd see the day."

"Oh, I believe it. It's bad here. You have no idea. They closed my school, Malcolm."

"What!" Malcolm shouted over the phone. "They closed it? They've got no right! Terrence, why didn't you call?!" 

"Oh, I would have, but then I had to move all my classroom gear, and we organized a local coalition, and we started a new school in a warehouse down the road. It was actually a blessing in diguise. My students are more dedicated than ever, and the parents are night and day from the old setup." 

"Wow, that's wonderful, I mean, I'm glad it's working out, but it's too bad you had to move. I'm sorry, Terrence, I wish I had been there to help."

"It's OK, bud, I know you would have. But really, are you OK? What's up?"

"Well." Malcolm sighed. "I need help, Terrence." 

"Anything, friend, you know I'm here."

"We've got some information about a move that *Veritas* is going to try and pull in your region. And we're going to intentionally let them get away with it."

"Oh? That sounds a little unorthodox. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised, coming from you."

"How many are in your network? Can you get a meeting together of your leaders?"

"Sure, we've actually got a meeting tomorrow night, does that work?"

"That's perfect! Can I call in? I'll send you a video link."

"OK, sounds good, Malcolm. It will be good to see your face, even if it's just on a screen."

Malcolm had aged considerably in the years since college. Terrence could see the lengthening wrinkles on his face and his hair thinning and graying. They were in their early 40s, but Malcolm looked *old*. Is that how Terrence looked to other people? He went and looked in a mirror to investigate. 

Wrinkles, sure, and hair a little lighter, too, but surely he wasn't old yet. He didn't *feel* old. 

"Folks, I hope to earn your trust with the information I'm about to share. I know that you have been working hard in Knoxville and beyond, and I'm amazed at the innovation you've demonstrated in your efforts. We've intercepted some information about *Veritas* action plans which concerns all of us - but will directly affect you." Malcolm spoke on the video screen in front of the Knoxville contingent. 

"*Veritas* plans to cut power to 100 schools in Appalachia sometime in the next 30 days."

Gasps and shouts erupted from the room.
