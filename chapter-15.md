As soon as Den and Aurora heard about the plans of *Veritas*, they knew they had to act. They brought Charlie and Luke to the curators' safe home near PS1, and joined the others in the school building to work out a counter-plan.  

If *Veritas* was going to interrupt power for a hundred schools in Appalachia, PS1 would catch them in the act, and broadcast the truth to the whole world. And they'd have a plan for restoring power, too.

What *Veritas* didn't know, and wouldn't expect, is that the schools in Appalachia were actually incredibly well networked and interlinked with the preservation movement. Sometimes a stereotype can provide great cover for subterfuge.
