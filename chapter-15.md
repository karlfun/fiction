As soon as Den and Aurora heard about the plans of *Veritas*, they knew they had to act. They brought Charlie and Luke to the curators' safe home near PS1, and joined the others in the school building to work out a counter-plan.  

If *Veritas* was going to interrupt power for a hundred schools in Appalachia, PS1 would catch them in the act, and broadcast the truth to the whole world. And they'd have a plan for restoring power, too.

What *Veritas* didn't know, and wouldn't expect, is that the schools in Appalachia were actually incredibly well networked and interlinked with the preservation movement. Sometimes a stereotype can provide great cover for subterfuge.

Malcolm called his friend Terrence Copley in Knoxville. Terrence was born and raised in Tennessee, and was a high school chemistry teacher in the city. He also happened to be one of the hosts of education preservation meetings happening quietly in coffee shops and living rooms across the state. Malcolm and Terrence knew each other from college, where they met playing ultimate frisbee and smoking pot between classes. 

"Terrence! How the hell are ya, bud?" Malcolm said on the phone.

"Malcolm, wow, it's been a long time..." Terrence trailed off. "I'm well, friend. It's good to hear from you. Is everything OK?"

"Fine, considering." Malcolm answered gruffly. "These shitbirds are really pushing this *Veritas* crap, even here in New York. Never thought I'd see the day."

"Oh, I believe it. It's bad here. You have no idea. They closed my school, Malcolm."

"What!" Malcolm shouted over the phone. "They closed it? They've got no right! Terrence, why didn't you call?!" 

"Oh, I would have, but then I had to move all my classroom gear, and we organized a local coalition, and we started a new school in a warehouse down the road. It was actually a blessing in diguise. My students are more dedicated than ever, and the parents are night and day from the old setup." 

"Wow, that's wonderful, I mean, I'm glad it's working out, but it's too bad you had to move. I'm sorry, Terrence, I wish I had been there to help."

"It's OK, bud, I know you would have. But really, are you OK? What's up?"

"Well." Malcolm sighed. "I need help, Terrence." 

"Anything, friend, you know I'm here."

"We've got some information about a move that *Veritas* is going to try and pull in your region. And we're going to intentionally let them get away with it."

"Oh? That sounds a little unorthodox. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised, coming from you."

"How many are in your network? Can you get a meeting together of your leaders?"

"Sure, we've actually got a meeting tomorrow night, does that work?"

"That's perfect! Can I call in? I'll send you a video link."

"OK, sounds good, Malcolm. It will be good to see your face, even if it's just on a screen."

Malcolm had aged considerably in the years since college. Terrence could see the lengthening wrinkles on his face and his hair thinning and graying. They were in their early 40s, but Malcolm looked *old*. Is that how Terrence looked to other people? He went and looked in a mirror to investigate. 

Wrinkles, sure, and hair a little lighter, too, but surely he wasn't old yet. He didn't *feel* old. 

"Folks, I hope to earn your trust with the information I'm about to share. I know that you have been working hard in Knoxville and beyond, and I'm amazed at the innovation you've demonstrated in your efforts." Malcolm spoke on the video screen in front of the Knoxville contingent. He would have loved to travel to Tennessee to see Terrence and meet his friends, but it was much safer connecting digitally these days. It was also tough to deliver such a serious message over video, but he knew he had to try.

"We've intercepted some information about *Veritas* action plans which concerns all of us - but will directly affect you." he continued.

"*Veritas* plans to cut power to 100 schools in Appalachia sometime in the next 30 days."

Gasps and shouts erupted from the room.

"How did you find out about this? How do you know it's true?" asked a member of the Knoxville advocates.

"I'll spare you the details, but let's just say we have some very advanced software engineers working with us in New York. Most - but not all - of the communication happening at *Veritas* headquarters is encrypted. You'll notice I said not *all*. They've dropped enough careless clues in public channels that we've pieced most of their plan together. 

"The basics are that sometime next month - everything has pointed to September - *Veritas* will permanently or indefinitely interrupt the power supply for as many as 100 schools in the region - from Nashville, to Lexington, to Charlotte, to Atlanta. Atlanta is obviously the biggest metro area, and Lexington may have more political targets, but you all in Knoxville are in the dead center of this circle, so you have the best strategic chance to thwart the plan. 

"What we're proposing - and please hear me out first, but then I want to hear from you - is to let them go through with their plan, but 1) catch them in the act with significant public documentation, and 2) bring power back to the schools as fast as possible. It would be a hit to education to lose power, of course, but we're also extremely concerned about the food services and other critical community services that all of these schools provide. We want refrigerators and freezers, and lights and heating and cooling, back online as soon as possible.

"Now, I've shared a lot of shocking information. What else do you want to know? How can my crew and I help you? And what do you want to do?"

Terrence spoke up first. 

"That's pretty wild, Malcolm. Thank you for taking the time to share with us. It is a lot to process, but I appreciate that you've brought us a proposed plan. I am sure we're all going to need time to think on it. I do have one question, though. Do you know any drone pilots?"

"As a matter of fact, I do." Malcolm answered with a smirk. Terrence knew that Malcolm was a drone pilot who had nearly lost his license for some urbex photography attempts in their college days. He had gone clean since then, just taking some jobs here and there for corporate clients, but work had slowed down as the fight for education heated up.

"What about the schools? Have you contacted administration? Teachers? School boards? They need to know about this!" another member of the Knoxville agitators asked. 

"It's tough to reach trustworthy contacts at the schools. As you all know - some school boards and administrators will actually be in on these plans already. So we're starting with you all. If you have friends in the schools who are at the absolute, utmost, top level of trust within your circles - it's OK to bring them in on this. But for now, I would urge caution." Malcolm answered.
