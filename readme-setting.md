# Setting for our story

The year is 2029. Education in the United States has been almost completely privatized. A few Midwestern strongholds still have public education, but have to fly under the radar as "craft schools." Schools are still taxpayer funded, but only through highly competitve grants. 

Universities are almost all private. Student debt has been nationalized into a tax collected from everyone. Student loan corporations have a stranglehold on Congress. 

Insider trading has created millionaires of all national elected officials, and billionaires of many of them. 

Students are suffering. Homelessness and unemployment are at the highest they have been since the Great Depression.
