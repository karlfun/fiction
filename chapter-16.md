The first day of September arrived in New York without much note. The weather was still hot, and the taxis were honking today just as much as they did yesterday. But tensions were higher than ever at PS1. This was the month when *Veritas* planned its big attack on schools in Appalachia. 

Preparations were underway throughout the school network. Everyone had a role to play, and everyone took it seriously. This was a chance to do something good, make a difference.
