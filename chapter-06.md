Traveling all the way to New York - by train and water - was a daunting prospect. Aurora used to travel all the time for work; New York was one of her favorite conference destinations. This time would be different.

Most plane travel now was reserved for the super rich. Oil prices were higher than they had ever been in history. High oil prices cratered a half-dozen industries - auto manufacturing, air travel, over-the-road trucking, and more. The only people flying were celebrities, pro sports teams, and national politicians. 

Fortunately, as the air and car industries declined, rail saw a resurgence in the country. Amtrak had re-opened three transcontinental routes from its heyday, as well as dozens of interurbans and local lines. Boston, New York, D.C. and Philadelphia all had high speed trains, and Florida was building tracks across the Keys.

But as the fight for education grew, the risks of traveling grew too.
