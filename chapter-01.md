# Chapter 1

"Aurora!" Den shouted. 

"Aurora! Where are you!?"

Den's cries barely sounded over the rush of flame, smoke, and hot air that whirled around the second floor reading room. His high-powered flashlight only shone a few feet in front of him through the dust and debris. He was glad to have a face mask, but the air was getting too thin to be in the Library for much longer. He had to find Aurora, and he hoped that Tillie and Bash would be OK. 

Ceiling tiles were popping and crashing down to the stacks. Full of water from the sprinkler system, they weren't insulating from sound or heat any more. The flames had fully engulfed the 19th Century collection. Maps, manuscripts, and thousands of volumes of out-of-print literature were already gone. The university's fire-safe system was designed to slow down the flow of air to the fire, stop the flames with water, and protect the books. Den took a moment to collect himself. He crouched down to get out of the smoke cloud and try to get some cleaner air. 

He realized the huge, metal shelving system on the first floor would probably have the best preserved books. It was prime real estate in the Library, visible from the front door, and full of the school's most important collection of books, the personal library of Charles K. Peterson, a business magnate who donated his estate to the university upon his passing. Den thought he had terrible taste in books, but he got rich somehow, so he must have known something about them. He decided to try to get to the shelves to see if Aurora might be there. 

He opened the heavy door to the stairs, only to let a rush of air pass through and fan the flames on the second floor. He had to hurry.

The stairwell was all concrete and steel, and the flames found no purchase here. But there was still the evidence of an emergency escape of hundreds of students and staff. Books, bags, pens, and papers were scattered over the landings. 

"AURORA!" he called again down the stairwell. Jumping down two, three stairs at a time, sometimes sliding on burnt books and other detritus, he raced to the first floor entrance. He pulled open the door and again sent a rush of air into the room, feeding the fire more of its favorite gas. 

"AURORA!" he yelled, exasperated. 

Goddamit she better be alive. I'll die if she's gone. 

"AURORA!" 

Still nothing. 

He ran to the metal shelving system. No offense to the Mr. Peterson, but this was the ugliest feature in the entire building. The building wasn't exactly an architectural gem - sort of a midcentury-meets-brutalist functional structure. But it was made with quality materials. Limestone exterior. Terrazzo floors. Brass fixtures and wall sconces. And then, a grey-brown metal behemoth just off the middle of the main floor - ten huge metal shelves on a track system. The shelves were 20 feet deep, 8 feet tall, and on a track system so you could only squeeze between two of the shelves at a time. If you were in the D-through-I aisle but you wanted to check the J-through-O row, you had to exit, and turn the huge crank on the shelf to move it slowly over on its track. It saved space in the building and crammed more of this cursed collection into the library. It also happened to be a moderately fireproof storage solution, since the books were stored more denseley here than anywhere else. 

When he got to the shelves, he noticed that all of them were rolled together. Must have been an automatic safety feature, he thought. He raced to the outside of the first row - A-through-C. And there, with her hand on the wheel, holding the row closed, was Aurora, unconscious.
