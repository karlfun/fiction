It had been years since PS1 was a museum. 

Once a school, then a warehouse, then a modern art museum and theater, and now, again, a school. 

When the cuts to public education started in the heartland, the curators at the MOMA PS1 proposed a change. The institution's mission was always to turn something unloved into something beautiful, inspiring, and educational. But art for art's sake started to lose its relevance when fascist forces revealed their true aims, and closed all of the school districts in Mississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee. Other states were soon to follow. The curators and the director of the Museum of Modern Art in the former Public School One building in Long Island, New York decided: We will open a school. Anyone will be allowed to attend. We will hire teachers from the community. We will teach literacy, skepticism, and creative problem solving. 

It didn't take long for the school to grow in popularity and support, but not all New Yorkers believed in the power of education. Mayor Milana De Rose - despite her past as a school administrator - had taken the side of the anti-educators. "School is an outdated institution. We're smarter than school," she was known for saying. She and her throng of supporters, mostly industry tycoons, business barons, and Wall-Street washouts bullied anyone and everyone who got in their way. 

Most, but not all of the trade unions were in support of education -- after all, apprenticeship is one of the oldest forms of education. Gregory Hart, President of TWU Local 100, was one of the most vocal in the fight for schools in New York. Despite being in charge of the city's chapter of the Transport Workers Union, Hart felt passionate about public education. His children, now grown, had gone through public schools in their childhood, and he saw what a benefit it was to their upbringing. 

The Transport Workers, the Laborers, the Public Employees, and the Communications Workers all had their own union halls in the city, but lately, the most important meetings happened at PS1. Hart and his colleagues did their best to make sure that the Long Island Railroad, and every other moving piece of the MTA, kept rolling through the budget cuts and the education conflict - in part so everyone could get to these meetings. On a monthly basis, the curators at PS1 had been hosting a community forum on the future of school. The first few meetings asked big questions, like "What is the future of education?" and "What makes a great teacher?" but these questions soon became tawdry luxuries. Now, each meeting was a practical discussion of strategy and tactics. The format was roughly the same each time. Hart, or a curator would call everyone to order, give a quick recap of the last meeting, and any progress or setbacks, and then split the room into tactical groups: Communications, Disruptors, Regional, National, and Water. 

Some of the Communications folks were former ad-industry moguls. Charming, good-looking, and very good at convincing people to buy stuff. Their skills were a boon to the public school advocates. Sometimes they worked closely with the Disruptors, but at other times, they would break out in argument. The Disruptors' methods were all a little too dramatic for their tastes, and of course, the Disruptors thought the Communications group never went far enough. 

The Regional and National coordinators were critical for getting supplies and information in and out of the city. New York was the center of the east coast's organizing efforts on education, and its power and connections brought success to other states up and down the coast, and even reaching westward into Appalachia. 

But for all of their efforts, and experience, and skills, none of the groups would work without the water group. Water encompassed about a dozen topics, all critical to the fight for education, but the most important was transport. Because of the anti-educators militarization efforts, most interstates and even some state highways were clogged with personnel transports, munitions supply, and rations trucks. Some of these were still government military operations - but others were private militias. Toll booths became checkpoints. Highway interchanges were plagued with high-tech surveillance. The only low-tech transport options left to the activist were the nation's waterways. 

If the water crew needed to send major supplies to a southern state, they could use the rivers -- or even a few of the tugboats owned by the Metro Transit Authority. If the tugboats could get out to 25 miles beyond the coast, they were in international waters, and could travel somewhat freely up and down the coast. Most of the country's allies had adopted a policy of "emergency aid only" in the American education conflict, and refused to engage with military, so the activists could usually count on safety at sea. 

The water group also had the privilege of welcoming education refugees to the city. Most people escaping the fascist destruction of schooling in other states arrived by boat, at night. New York City was a big place, and there was always room for a few more. 

It had been years since PS1 was a museum. It was now a school, a war room, a grocery store, and a neatly apportioned apartment block - all within blocks of transit and water access to the city and beyond.
