It had been years since PS1 was a museum. 

Once a school, then a warehouse, then a modern art museum and theater, and now, again, a school. 
When the cuts to public education started in the heartland, the curators at the MOMA PS1 proposed a change. The institution's mission was always to turn something unloved into something beautiful, inspiring, and educational. But art for art's sake started to lose its relevance when fascist forces revealed their true aims, and closed all of the school districts in Mississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee. Other states were soon to follow. The curators and the director of the Museum of Modern Art in the former Public School One building in Long Island, New York decided: We will open a school. Anyone will be allowed to attend. We will hire teachers from the community. We will teach literacy, skepticism, and creative problem solving. 
It didn't take long for the school to grow in popularity and support, but not all New Yorkers believed in the power of education. Mayor Milana De Rose - despite her past as a school administrator - had taken the side of the anti-educators. "School is an outdated institution. We're smarter than school," she was known for saying. She and her throng of supporters, mostly industry tycoons, business barons, and Wall-Street washouts bullied anyone and everyone who got in their way. 
Most, but not all of the trade unions were in support of education -- after all, apprenticeship is one of the oldest forms of education. Gregory Hart, President of TWU Local 100, was one of the most vocal in the fight for schools in New York. Despite being in charge of the city's chapter of the Transport Workers Union, Hart felt passionate about public education. His children, now grown, had gone through public schools in their childhood, and he saw what a benefit it was to their upbringing. 
The Transport Workers, the Laborers, the Public Employees, and the Communications Workers all had their own union halls in the city, but lately, the most important meetings happened at PS1. Hart and his colleagues did their best to make sure that the Long Island Railroad, and every other moving piece of the MTA, kept rolling through the budget cuts and the education conflict - in part so everyone could get to these meetings. On a monthly basis, the curators at PS1 had been hosting a community forum on the future of school. The first few meetings asked big questions, like "What is the future of education?" and "What makes a great teacher?" but these questions soon became tawdry luxuries. Now, each meeting
